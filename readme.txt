= How Do You Create Video Lists and Show them? =

Getting started with Simple Media Directory is super easy but the plugin works a little different from others - so an introduction is necessary. The most important thing to remember is that the base pillars of this video gallery or video portfolio plugin are Lists, not individual links or categories. A list is simply a niche or subtopic to group your relevant Videos together. The most common use of SMD is to create and display multiple Lists of Video Galleries on specific topics or subtopics on the same page. Everything revolves around the Video Lists. Once you create a few Video Lists, you can then display them in many different ways.

With that in mind you should start with the following simple steps.

1. Go to New List and create one by giving it a name. Then simply start adding List items or links by filling up the fields you want. Use the Add New button to add more Listings in your list.

2. Though you can just create one list and use the Single List mode. This video directory plugin works the best when you create a few Video Lists or Video Galleries - each conatining about 15-20 List items. This is the most usual use case scenario. But you can do differently once you get the idea.

3. Now go to a page or post where you want to display the directory. On the right sidebar you will see a ShortCode Generator block. Click the button and a Popup LightBox will appear with all the options that you can select. Choose All Lists, and select a Style. Then Click Add Shortcode button. Shortcode will be generated. Simply copy paste that to a location on your page where you want the directory to show up.

Thatâ€™s it! The above steps are for the basic usages. If you had any specific questions about how something works, do not hesitate to contact us from the Support Forum. ðŸ™‚

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the free version have filter buttons? =
No. It is a pro version feature at the moment. But in the future, we have plans to make it available in the free version as well.

= Iâ€™m having trouble grasping the use of categories. It seems like and that they can only be assigned to a list rather than a specific link. =
The base pillars of SMD are Lists, not individual links. The most common use case scenario of SLD is to create and display multiple Lists of many Links on specific topics. As such, there is no option for a Link (list item) to belong to multiple Lists or Categories. That would make the process of creating Lists slower. For each link you would have to select a List and a Category from drop downs despite the chances of a single List item to belong to multiple Lists are usually not that high. When you have dozens or hundreds of Lists that would become a real issue to create or manage your Lists.

= I have a list to import but it does not work and there is no message saying why my import does not work. =
The most common reason for failed import is encoding. The CSV file itself and characters in it must be in utf-8 format. Please check your CSV file for any unusual/non-utf-8 characters. If the problem persists, please email us the CSV file.


= I have setup List Categories and Lists and neither is showing on home page. Did I install correctly? =
You have to put the short code on the WordPress oage or post page where you want to show the List/s. There is a Shortcode generator in your page or post visual editor. Use that to create shortcode and insert to your page, where you want to display the lists, easily.

= Is SLD mobile friendly? Does it function well on cells and tablets? =
Yes, all templates are mobile device friendly and Responsive.

= Why can I not add more than 37(or any other) number of links in one list? =
The issue you are having with saving the Lists is because of a limitation set in your server. Your server probably has a low limit for how many form fields it will process at a time. So, after you have added a certain number of links, the server refuses to save new link items. The serverâ€™s configuration that dictates this is max_input_vars. Set it to a high limit like max_input_vars = 10000. You can do it with local php.ini file or htaccess if your server supports it, Otherwise, please contact your hosting company support if needed.

= How Can I Translate Your Plugin or Use Another Language Besides English? =
We are working on better multi language support. In the mean time, you can use either WPML with String Translation addon or the Loco Translate plugin â€“ which is free. If any string is missing, let us know.
